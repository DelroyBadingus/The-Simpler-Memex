# Del's Memex
### <u>This vault was created by Delroy Goveas in January 2022</u>

### <u>Updates - March 10 : </u>
Hi, Delroy here back with the second edition of my memex. In my first evaluation, I really did not give myself the chance to fully work through and complete a ideal project. For this memex, I hope you will find it more enjoyable with what I have added into the mix. The new notes focus mostly on Alexander Graham Bell, Alan Turing and the physicality of paper.

### <u>Description: </u>
What you are observing right now is a memex. As described in the article [['As We May Think']], a memex is a filesystem where every bit of essential info is found in a single place. Thus, in the case of this vault's memex, you will find thoughtful notes informing you of certain early conception or rather the history of the internet. This memex is divided below into three parts. The parts are divided as follows: (1) Sources or source notes, (2) thoughts or idea notes, and (3) concepts or atomic notes.
