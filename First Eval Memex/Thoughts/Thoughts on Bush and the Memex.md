This reading was particularily interesting. I feel that a lot of what Bush describes is seemingly true (with somewhat delusional thinking here and there). He talks a on large part about the technical marvels of his era which I feel we now take advantage of. 
>"The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships."


There are some indications here and there that Bush may be misogynist such as when he constantly refers to evolution being related solely to man. An example of this is:
> "Of what lasting benefit has been **manâ€™s** use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence?"
