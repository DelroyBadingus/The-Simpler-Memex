A memex, as described by Vannevar Bush, is a compressed system where every bit of important information you need is all at a single desk. This concept is practically what we view now as the internet, which is everywhere! Our phones are like the memex; we can communicate with others, access information from google, and even write and compose notes that save themselves automatically. We may be far away from Bush's earliest conception, but there is no doubt that the majority of what he described in his article "As We May Think" is realistic of what we now have accessible from a click or button push away.
