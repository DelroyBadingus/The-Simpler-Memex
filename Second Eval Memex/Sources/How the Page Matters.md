### Summary & Key Take Aways
This reading observes how important paper, among other things, is important in its foundation and the stories it tells. If we look at early types of writing forms, they all took place on materials such as papyrus and were hard to come by. Now that paper is accessible to us, it like other writings, tells histories. One interesting quote I found in the first chapter of her book was that:
> "[...]on parchment, paper, and computer, and in manuscript, print, and digital forms - it possesses an ideal material material history for our examination of the page." (Mak, 2011)
