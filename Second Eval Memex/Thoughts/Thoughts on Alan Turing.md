To me Alan Turing was a definitively important person in Britain's involvement during World War 2. His work on the bombe clearly helped secure the safety of Britain and like wise allowed I feel as though his contributions were simply disregarded by British people during the period where he was robbed and convicted of gross indecency. The conviction of indencency was simply used unjustly to both criminalize his sexuality and force him to be chemically castrated. What happened to Turing is even more upsetting when it is found out that he was only pardoned 60 years after being abitralily convicted.
