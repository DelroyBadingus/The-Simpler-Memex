Mak's reading is interesting but I feel as though she writes in a very philosophical way, in contrast to others when describing paper. There is, however, a great deal of her talking about how these media (such as computer) have incredibly important histories. I relate to that and look at myself and how I have hundreds of books in my house both read and to read. These books may not be important to someone else but they are important to me and how I see myself historically.
